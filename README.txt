 Be careful, the current version of ORM code generator is extremely sensitive to the SQL formatof input file even to the tabs and space quantinty. It is actually the greatest weakness of the current code revision which should be fixed as soon as possible.
 To try the code use User.sql file with the sample input data which also exists in repository. Use this file format as the strict pattern to your input data. 

 Also to start working with ORM you should copy manually php-files with parent classes to your project form /parents directory.
